# Snakes
Local play snake game for 3DS homebrew/cfw

This is just in Alpha stage right now.

Ignore the failed experiment source. I am only keeping it in case there's a workaround.
the failed experiment was an attempt at using sf2d and sftd to draw unicode characters instead of using a console.
I couldn't get sf2d and UDS to work together.


Things to do:
-Test with 5-8 players
-Try to join a full room
