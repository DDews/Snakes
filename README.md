# Snakes
Local play snake game for 3DS homebrew/cfw

_This is in BETA stage right now._

For more information, check out the GBATemp thread: https://gbatemp.net/threads/beta-release-snakes-local-play-1-8-players.456194/


_Note:_ Ignore the failed experiment source. I am only keeping it in case there's a workaround.
the failed experiment was an attempt at using sf2d and sftd to draw unicode characters instead of using a console.
I couldn't get sf2d and UDS to work together.


Things to do:
 - [ ] Try to join a full room
 - [ ] Break things, and fix them.
