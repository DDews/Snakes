# Snakes
Local play snake game for 3DS homebrew/cfw

_This is just in Alpha stage right now._



_Note:_ Ignore the failed experiment source. I am only keeping it in case there's a workaround.
the failed experiment was an attempt at using sf2d and sftd to draw unicode characters instead of using a console.
I couldn't get sf2d and UDS to work together.


Things to do:
 - [ ] Test with 5-8 players
 - [ ] Try to join a full room
 - [ ] Upload video of 4 players playing
